    <h3 id = 'home'> History  </h3>
    With every passing year there has been an increasing number of animals <br />
    that are being placed in the shelters. This has caused an issue where there <br />
    have been many animals coming into the shelter but little to none are adopted. <br />
    Leading to many having to be put down instead of finding new families.
